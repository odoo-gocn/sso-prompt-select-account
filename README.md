Odoo module that ensures the Microsoft Single Sign-On flow always prompts users to select an account when logging in with Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), developed by [Go On Associated](https://goonassociated.odoo.com/).

This module adds the *`prompt=select_account`* parameter to the Microsoft SSO login URL, allowing users to choose which Microsoft account to authenticate with. Without this parameter, the login flow may automatically select the first active session, which can cause confusion for users who manage multiple accounts. This enhancement ensures a more flexible and user-friendly login experience‚Äîparticularly in environments where account switching is frequent.
